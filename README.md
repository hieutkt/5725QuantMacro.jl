[![Build Status](https://github.com/hieutkt/QuantMacro.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/hieutkt/QuantMacro.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This repository contains selected code from Juan Sanchez's "Quantitative Macroeconomics" course at Washington University in St. Louis. It includes a variety of utilities for solving dynamic economic models. The following are some exercises provided:

- The [Neo-classical growth model](https://github.com/hieutkt/QuantMacro.jl/blob/main/src/models/neoclassicalgrowth.jl)
- Models of [income fluctuation](https://github.com/hieutkt/QuantMacro.jl/blob/main/src/models/incomefluctuations.jl)
- [Household finance](https://github.com/hieutkt/QuantMacro.jl/blob/main/src/models/household-finance.jl)
- [Household lifecycle](https://github.com/hieutkt/QuantMacro.jl/blob/main/src/models/household-lifecycle.jl) problems
- Models of [sovereign default](https://github.com/hieutkt/QuantMacro.jl/blob/main/src/models/sovereign-default.jl)
- The [Krusell-Smith model](https://github.com/hieutkt/QuantMacro.jl/blob/main/src/models/krusell-smith.jl)
